# Contributing to Voodoo-SAP

Thanks for helping make these samples better! This repository is intentionally lightweight, so the contribution process is too:

1. **Fork the repo** and work off the `main` branch.
2. **Keep examples focused.** Small ABAP snippets, docs, or fixes are easier to review than giant rewrites.
3. **Follow SAP-safe habits.**
   - Use descriptive names and comments.
   - Do not paste real customer data, credentials, or system IDs.
   - Keep credentials and secrets out of version control.
4. **Style guidelines.**
   - Match the existing ABAP formatting (UPPERCASE keywords, 2-space indents for continuation lines).
   - Keep docs in Markdown under `docs/` and ABAP samples under `abap/`.
5. **Open a Pull Request.** Describe what you changed, why, and how to test it (if applicable). Issues and discussions are welcome too.
